# Hearthstone
### Hearthstone Game Implemented using Java.

This was a project to learn OOP in college. 
they provided us with the Minions CSV and the game extracts the minions information from it. 

the game uses pure java libraries and uses Java swing for the GUI 
(The GUI was a bonus part of the project but my team and I took it personal and worked very hard on it and wrote more than 3000 lines of code
to make the game look good as close to the original as possible.
