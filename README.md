# Hearthstone
### Hearthstone Game Implemented using Java.

This was a project to learn OOP in college. 
they provided us with the Minions CSV and the game extracts the minions information from it. 

the game uses pure java libraries and uses Java swing for the GUI <br>
#### The GUI was a bonus part of the project
but my team and I took it personal and worked very hard on it and wrote more than 3000 lines of code
to make the game look good and as close to the original as possible. 
The game should also work on any resolution (perferably 1080p and 16:9 aspect ratios) since all the width and height units that we used were
relative to 16:9 aspect ratio 

(example: 500px width will be written as 500/1920 * screen width) 

the game mostly uses Null Layout since we wanted a little bit of freedom to place any object.
which required more work but was worth it at the end.
